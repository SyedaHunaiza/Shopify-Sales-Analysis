# Shopify-Sales-Analysis Jan-Mar 2024
Objective: The primary aim of this project was to conduct an in-depth analysis of Shopify sales data from January to March 2024 in order to uncover key business insights related to revenue trends, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior.
This project offers a comprehensive data driven exploration of Shopify sales spanning the first quarter of 2024. Leveraging Microsoft Excel as the primary tool, the analysis aimed to extract actionable business insights by transforming raw transactional data into a well-structured and interactive report. The dataset was cleaned and refined to ensure consistency, accuracy, and readability. Key computed fields include Revenue per Order, derived using the formula =Price * Quantity, and date-related columns such as Month and Month Name, extracted using Excel’s =MONTH() and =TEXT() functions for time based aggregation. To conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis, I utilized Pivot Tables to summarize core metrics including monthly sales performance, top-selling products, customer purchase behavior, and product category profitability. Additional fields such as repeat customers and regional trends (if applicable) were also analyzed to gain a holistic view of customer engagement and product demand. The highlight of this project is a dynamic Sales Dashboard, which integrates a series of visual elements such as clustered column charts, pie charts, and ranked tables to present key insights in an intuitive and visually compelling format. Excel Slicers were employed to allow interactive filtering across multiple dimensions including Month, Product Category, and Customer Name, thereby enabling users to explore trends and drill down into specific segments effortlessly. Significant findings from the analysis include a revenue peak in March, with Water Bottle emerging as the highest selling product by volume. The Apparel category led in terms of profitability, and repeat customers contributed substantially to overall sales, emphasizing customer retention as a growth lever.
This project showcases how advanced Excel functionalities—formulas, pivot tables, slicers, and visual design can be harmoniously combined to produce a professional grade analysis that bridges data with decision-making.
