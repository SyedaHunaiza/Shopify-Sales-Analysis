# Shopify-Sales-Analysis Jan-Mar 2024
This project presents a detailed analysis of Shopify sales data from January to March 2024 using Microsoft Excel. I cleaned and structured the raw data, calculated revenue per order using the formula =Price * Quantity, and extracted month names from order dates using =MONTH() and =TEXT(Date, "mmm"). Using pivot tables, I explored sales trends, identified the top-selling products, most profitable categories, best-performing customers, and repeat buyer behavior. To visualize the results, I designed a sales dashboard with interactive bar charts, pie charts, and leaderboards that clearly highlight performance across months and categories. Key insights from the analysis include March being the highest revenue month, Water Bottle as the best-selling product, and Apparel as the most profitable category. This project demonstrates how spreadsheet tools and simple logic can turn raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence.
